# Linux Shell Scripting: Control Flow

This project documents my experience learning and applying **control flow concepts in shell scripting**. I practiced different types of loops and explored how they control the flow of execution in a script.

## What is Control Flow?

Control flow refers to the order in which instructions, statements, or function calls are executed or evaluated. In shell scripting, this typically involves **conditional statements** and **loops**, which allow a script to perform repetitive tasks and make decisions dynamically.

## Loops in Shell Scripting

### 1. Basic `for` Loop

This loop iterates over a list of items.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for i in 1 2 3 4 5
do
  echo "Counting... $i"
done
```

### 2. `for` Loop Using a Range

This style simplifies looping over a sequence.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..5}
do
  echo "Counting... $i"
done
```

### 3. C-style `for` Loop

This loop mimics the C language syntax for more complex conditions.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for (( i=0; i<5; i++ ))
do
  echo "Counting... $i"
done
```

## Task Execution Summary

1. âœ… Created a shell script for each type of `for` loop.
2. âœ… Inserted the appropriate loop code into each file.
3. âœ… Set execution permissions using `chmod +x script_name.sh`.
4. âœ… Executed and tested each script on a Linux terminal.

## Reflections

- Learning about different control flow structures has made me more confident in automating tasks using bash.
- The ability to customize loop conditions helps handle a wide range of scenarios.
- Using C-style loops made me feel like combining the power of traditional programming logic with shell scripting simplicity.

ðŸ§  Knowledge Gained:
- Syntax and usage of `for`, range-based, and C-style loops.
- Importance of file permissions (`chmod`) in executing scripts.
- Practical debugging of loop logic and script flow.
