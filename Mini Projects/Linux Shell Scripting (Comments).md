## 🏷️ 1. How to Add Comments in Bash

### 📌 Single-Line Comments
Use `#` at the beginning of a line to add a **single-line comment**:
```sh
# This script prints "Hello, World!"
echo "Hello, World!"
```

### 📌 Multi-Line Comments
Although Bash doesn’t support multi-line comments natively, you can use  multiple `#` symbols:
```sh
# This is the first line of a multi-line comment
# This is the second line of the same comment
```
