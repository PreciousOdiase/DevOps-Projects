### ðŸ“œ **Mini Project - Error Handling Summary**

I learned the critical importance of anticipating and managing errors to ensure script reliability, particularly when creating AWS S3 buckets.

#### ðŸ”§ **Key Techniques & Concepts**

- **Bucket Existence Check**  
  Used the `aws s3api head-bucket` command to verify if a bucket already exists before attempting to create it. This prevents errors from duplicate bucket creation attempts.

- **Conditional Statements for Error Handling**  
  Leveraged `if/else` statements to evaluate command exit statuses (`$?`) and respond accordingly:
  - Skip creation if the bucket already exists
  - Provide clear, actionable feedback such as: _"S3 bucket already exists."_

- **Automation Across Departments**  
  Automated bucket creation for departments like Marketing and Sales using loops, and incorporated individual error handling per operation.
